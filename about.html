          <p>
            I’m Max, a recent graduate and web technology enthusiast. I
            graduated from The Robert Gordon university with a BSc in Digital
            Media: Design, Production and Development. During my time at
            university I completed a number of projects from a wide variety of
            digital disciplines. Since graduation I have worked on a number of
            personal and freelance web-focused projects. <br /><br />
            While the majority of my experience is in front-end design,
            development and UX (Adobe CC, Html, CSS, JavaScript), I do also have
            some familiarity with back-end languages and technologies (pHp,
            Node.js). I also have a wide range of experience in the hospitality
            and warehouse industry.<br /><br />
            Please get in touch if you’d like to know more about me!

          <p>
            I take care to produce unique and captivating designs that
            incorporate current and best practices. I am comfortable using
            industry-standard software to create informative wireframe models,
            detailed mock-ups and high quality assets for all of the projects I
            work on. By using a mobile-frist approach I can create designs that
            work on a wide variety of device types and platforms.

          <h3 class="text-secondary">Development</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy working on challenging coding tasks and problems. I use
            modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript to bring engaging front-end designs
            to life. I like to keep my skills up to date and often spend time
            learning how to incorporate new frameworks and techniques into my
            projects.

          <h3 class="text-secondary">User Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Considering the user experience is crucial to the success of any
            project. I evaluate the suitability of a design by considering how
            an end-user might interact with it. Testing with potential users or
            creating personas, using techniques such as cognitive walkthroughs
            and heuristic evaluations, enable me to feel confident in my
            solutions.
